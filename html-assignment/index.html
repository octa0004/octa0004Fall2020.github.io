        <p> Hello, my name is Tina Octaviani and I am from Indonesia, 
            and this will be my 1<sup>st</sup> year at <strong>Algonquin College </strong>
            enrolled in <em>Interactive Media Design </em> even though I don't know anything 
            about coding, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>.
            I enjoy exploring many forms of art, such as digital illustration, calligraphy, food sculpture, photography, and crafts.
            My online creative process journal is in Behance and Instagram.

            When I was a child, 
            I was always fond of how pretty magazines and book covers look.
            Since then, I dreamed that one day I would be able to make pretty things
            that matter to many people.
            Before I went to Algonquin College, I completed a degree in Design Communication. 
            I got a taste of the industry, in which the majority of projects done used print media.
