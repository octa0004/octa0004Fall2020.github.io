    <article> <strong>About Me </strong></article>
    <p> Hello, my name is Tina Octaviani and I am from Indonesia, 
        and this will be my first year at Algonquin College 
        enrolled in Interactive Media Design even though I don't know anything 
        about coding and HTML.
        I enjoy exploring many forms of art, 
        such as digital illustration, calligraphy, food sculpture, photography, and crafts.<br>
