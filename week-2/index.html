    <article> <strong>About Me </strong></article>
    <p> Hello, my name is Tina Octaviani and I am from Indonesia, 
        and this will be my first year at <strong>Algonquin College </strong>
        enrolled in Interactive Media Design even though I don't know anything 
        about coding and HTML.
        I enjoy exploring many forms of art, 
        such as digital illustration, calligraphy, food sculpture, photography, and crafts.<br>
<br>
        When I was a child, 
        I was always fond of how pretty magazines and book covers look.
        Since then, I dreamed that one day I would be able to make pretty things
        that matter to many people.
        Before I went to Algonquin College, I completed a degree in Design Communication. 
        I got a taste of the industry, in which the majority of projects done used print media.
